#1. TEST DATA management
Description: Test data management involves organizing, maintaining, and utilizing data required for executing test cases.
This could be data for form inputs, user credentials, or expected results.

#Implementation:
External Data Files: Store test data in external files like CSV, JSON, XML, or Excel files. These can be read by the test scripts using libraries like pandas or csv.
Environment-Specific Data: Use different data sets for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) by organizing data files in environment-specific directories.
Data-driven Testing: Implement data-driven testing by parameterizing test cases to run with multiple data sets.

#2. PAGE OBJECT MODEL (POM)
Description: The Page Object Model is a design pattern that helps create an abstraction layer for web pages. 
Each page or component of the application is represented as a class, with methods that interact with elements on the page.

#Implementation:
Page Classes: Create a class for each page (e.g., LoginPage, HomePage, ProductPage) where you define locators and methods for interacting with page elements.
Reusability: Methods within the page classes are reused across different test cases, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

#3. TEST CASE ORGANIZATION
Description: Test cases should be organized in a logical structure, making it easy to navigate, update, and execute them.

#Implementation:
Test Classes: Group related test cases into test classes (e.g., test_login.py, test_checkout.py).
Naming Conventions: Use descriptive names for test methods to clearly indicate their purpose.
Setup and Teardown: Implement setup and teardown methods in test classes for common preconditions (like opening a browser) and postconditions (like closing a browser).

#4. REPORTING
Description: Reporting involves generating detailed reports of test execution, including pass/fail status, error logs, screenshots, and more.

#Implementation:
Allure or HTML Reports: Use reporting libraries like Allure or HTMLTestRunner to generate comprehensive reports.
Logging: Implement logging within test cases to track the execution flow and capture useful information for debugging.
